## An Angular SPA
The goal is to build an online environment where kids can playfully learn to code
There is a renderer that renders the StageItem onto canvases
There is kind of a physics engine that is applied by using transformers


## Instructions
- Follow the best practices of clean code
- keep classes and methods small and focused
- favour composition over inheritance
- follow the dry rule
- write and check relevant unit tests with implementation
- run tests with every implementation
- keep the MAP_JSON_SCHEMA.md up to date after additions and changes to the map structure
- keep a clean separation of concers and make sure things are always clean and dont mix
